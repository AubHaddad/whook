This is the [Whook](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook) server
 CLI tool. Its goal is to allow you to create commands right in
 your project instead of in external tools.
By doing so, it provides you a convenient way to reuse your
 Whook's project configuration, services and handlers easily
 in you day to day command line programs.

To create new commands, you simply have to create new files in
 the `src/commands` folder of your Whook project and let the
 autoloader detect it ;).

By setting `@whook/cli` in the `WHOOK_PLUGINS` constant, you will
 benefit of [the commands provided by this module](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/tree/master/packages/whook-cli/src/commands):
```diff
  // (...)
  // Setup your own whook plugins or avoid whook defaults by leaving it empty
-  $.register(constant('WHOOK_PLUGINS', ['@whook/whook']));
+  $.register(constant('WHOOK_PLUGINS', ['@whook/cli', '@whook/whook']));
  // (...)
```

See the [Whook example server commands](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/tree/master/packages/whook-example/src/commands)
 for simple examples on creating your own commands in a `whook` project.

You can also create a new command by running:
```sh
npx whook create --type commands
```

## Dev

To test the CLI script, go to a project (in this repo `@whook/example`):
```sh
npm run build
cd ../whook-example

# Debugging compiled commands
node ../whook-cli/bin/whook.js ls

# Debugging source commands
PROJECT_SRC="$PWD/src" NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development} npm run cli -- ts-node --esm --files -- ../whook-cli/bin/whook.js ls
```
