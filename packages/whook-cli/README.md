[//]: # (::contents:start)

This is the Whook server CLI tool. To create new commands, you simply
 have to create new files in the `src/commands` folder of your Whook
 project.

By setting `@whook/cli` in the `WHOOK_PLUGINS` constant, you will
 benefit of the commands
 [embedded in this plugin](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/tree/master/packages/whook-cli/src/commands).

See the [Whook example server commands](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/tree/master/packages/whook-example/src/commands)
 for simple examples on creating your own commands in a `whook` project.

## Dev

To test the CLI script, go to a project (in this repo `@whook/example`):
```sh
npm run compile
cd ../whook-example

# Debugging compiled commands
node ../whook-cli/bin/whook.js ls

# Debugging source commands
PROJECT_SRC="$PWD/src" NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development} npm run cli -- babel-node --extensions '.ts,.js' -- ../whook-cli/bin/whook.js ls
```
