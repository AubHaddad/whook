Why write code when you have an OpenAPI definition?

# Summary

Whook eats your documentation and provide you with a
 performant router that take care of running the right
 code for the right operation.

By using the OpenAPI standard and the dependency injection
 pattern, Whook provides a convenient, highly modular and easily
 testable back end framework.

# Usage

**Work in progress**

I'd like to end up with a quick start guide looking like that:
```sh
# Initialize the project
mkdir simple_server && cd simple_server;
npm init whook simple_server;
npm install;

# Check install with a dry run of the server
DRY_RUN=1 npm run start
```

But atm, I only need it for my projects so leaving this as is
 in the meanwhile. If you're still motivated to use it, you
 should be prepared to face issues. That said, I'll help as
 much as I can if you have any question.

# Principles
This projects aims to make creating well documented and highly
 customizable REST APIs a breeze.

By relying on the [OpenAPI format](https://www.openapis.org/)
 to declare a new endpoint, this project forces documentation before code.
It also is highly customizable since based on the dependency injection
 with inversion of control pattern allowing you to override or wrap its main
 constituents.

![Architecture Overview](./overview.svg)

The Whook route handling flow is very simple.

First, we have a HTTPServer that handles requests an serve responses
 (the `httpServer` service).

Then, the `httpTransaction` transform the NodeJS requests into raw
 serializable ones (raw objects with no methods nor internal states).

Then the router (`httpRouter`) deal with that request to test which
 handler need to be run by comparing the method/path couple with the
 OpenAPI operations declarations.

Once found, it simply runs the right handler with the OpenAPI
 parameters value filled from the serializable request. The handler
 simply have to return a serializable response object in turn.

If any error occurs within this process, than the `errorHandler`
 is responsible for providing the now lacking response object
 based on the error it catches.

And that's it, you have your REST API. We have
 [no middleware](http://insertafter.com/en/blog/no_more_middlewares.html)
 concept here. Instead, every handler is a simple function taking an object
 and returning another one. It makes those objects very easily composable
 (in a functional programming sense).

You may add global wrappers to change every handlers input/output on the
 fly or add a local wrapper specifically to one of a few handlers.

# Contributing

Clone this project repository and run:

```sh
npm i
```

The repository is based on LernaJS that allows to host several NPM
 packages in a single repository. That said, to keep it simple
 it only proxies the packages commands.
