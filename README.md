# whook
> Build strong and efficient REST web services.

`whook` allows you to create REST web services by providing
 its ingredients and the recipe to make it work altogether.

The recipe is your Open API definition while ingredients
 are handlers, services and their configuration.

## Principles
Whook work by adding ingredients to you API:
- configuration: Whokk look ups for `config/{NODE_ENV}/config.js` files. It creates
 constants you can inject in your handlers and services.
- API: It defines the various endpoint of you API and how to map these to handlers
 thanks to the well known OpenAPI format (formerly Swagger),
- handlers: the code that implement those endpoints,
- services: various services that deal with global states,
- wrappers: higher order functions you can apply to handlers (CORS, authentication...).

Whook is built over Knifecyle which is great for adding or easily override/wrap
 a lot of its core component. It brings instrumentation and testability to
 your code bases.

Whook also rely on `swagger-http-router` which is a the heart of its routing
 system.

## Work in progress

I'd like to end up with a quick start guide looking like that:
```sh
# Initialize the project
mkdir simple_server && cd simple_server;
npm init whook simple_server;
npm install;

# Check install with a dry run of the server
DRY_RUN=1 npm run start
```

But atm, I only need it for my projects so leaving this as is
 in the meanwhile. If you're still motivated to use it, you
 should take a look to this project's
 [architecture notes](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
